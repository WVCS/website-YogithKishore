      <H3> Subjects </H3>
      <p2> At school, I enjoy subjects such as biology, psychology, computer science, and calculus. After studying them, I've figured out what subjects I enjoy over others. Some of the subjects I struggle with are Chemistry as well as History. </p2>

      <H3> Hobbies </H3>
      <p3> As mentioned earlier, I really enjoy writing. I prefer creative writing as it a way for my to freely express myself. Tied to this, I really enjoy reading. My favorite author is Rick Riordan, who's most famous series is probably "Percy Jackson". Many of his books focus on varius aspects of different mythologies. My favorite series include the "Kane Chronicles", focusing on Egyption Mythology, and "Magnus Chase", focusing on Norse Mythology.
      <br>
        I also really gaming. Some of my favorite games include Minecraft, Don't Starve Together, Genshin Impact, and Honkai Star Rail.</p3>
